According to the [Reddit thread "A Roadmap For Self-Learning Economics"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/pdt5nh/a_roadmap_for_selflearning_economics/) there are 3 recommended sources for self-learning economics:

1.  [Mankiw's "Principles of Economics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Economics_(Mankiw_book)) is one of the most widely used introductory economics textbooks. It covers both microeconomics and macroeconomics, written by Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw. The book is known for its clear explanations of economic concepts and real-world applications.

2.  [Marginal Revolution University (MRU)](https://mru.org/) is an online educational platform created by economists Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok. They provide free economics education through videos and interactive content. Their courses cover everything from principles of economics to more specialized topics like development economics and monetary policy.

3.  [CORE (Curriculum Open-access Resources in Economics) Econ](https://www.core-econ.org/), also known as "The Economy," is a modern approach to teaching economics that was developed as an alternative to traditional textbooks. It's freely available online and integrates current economic issues, historical context, and empirical evidence into its curriculum. CORE emphasizes real-world applications and starts with more contemporary economic questions rather than traditional abstract models.

What are the 3 recommended sources for self-learning economics? 

Claude said:

1. **"Core Economics"** (core-econ.org) - A free, comprehensive online textbook and learning platform designed for modern economics education. It covers both micro and macroeconomics with interactive tools and real-world examples.

2. **Khan Academy's Economics Courses** - Free structured video courses covering basic to intermediate concepts in both microeconomics and macroeconomics. Great for visual learners and includes practice problems.

3. **"The Undercover Economist" by Tim Harford** - An engaging introduction to economic thinking through real-world examples. This book helps develop economic intuition and makes complex concepts accessible.

## Books

1. Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner
2. The Armchair Economist by Steven E. Landsburg
3. The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable by Nassim Taleb

Claude "Can you elaborate on their philosophical and historical background?": 

> Let me break down the philosophical and historical context of each:
>
> 1. Mankiw's Principles represents mainstream neoclassical economics that emerged in the late 19th century. His approach is deeply rooted in:
> - The marginalist revolution (Jevons, Menger, Walras) that introduced marginal utility theory
> - The Chicago School's emphasis on free markets and rational choice theory
> - A methodological individualist approach where economic phenomena are explained through individual choices
> His famous "10 principles" embody core neoclassical assumptions like rational self-interest and market efficiency. The text largely reflects the "Washington Consensus" that dominated economic policy thinking in the 1980s-90s.
> 
> 2. Marginal Revolution University's name itself references the marginalist revolution, but their approach is more heterodox:
> - Strong influence from Austrian Economics (particularly Hayek's emphasis on knowledge problems and spontaneous order)
> - Public Choice Theory (studying political behavior through economic methods)
> - New Institutional Economics (focus on how institutions shape economic behavior)
> Cowen and Tabarrok often emphasize market solutions but are more willing to acknowledge market failures and behavioral economics insights than traditional neoclassicals.
> 
> 3. CORE Econ represents a post-2008 financial crisis approach:
> - Explicitly rejects the traditional neoclassical starting point of perfect competition and rational actors
> - Incorporates insights from behavioral economics, institutional economics, and complexity theory
> - Emphasizes historical context, power relationships, and environmental constraints
> - Influenced by scholars like Joseph Stiglitz who argue for a more nuanced view of market efficiency
> - Places greater emphasis on inequality and sustainability than traditional texts
> 
> A key philosophical difference between these approaches is their view of markets:
> - Mankiw tends to emphasize market efficiency and minimal government intervention
> - MRU takes a more nuanced view but still generally favors market solutions
> - CORE is more skeptical of market outcomes and more open to various forms of market intervention
> 
> Their methodological approaches also differ:
> - Mankiw relies heavily on simplified models and deductive reasoning
> - MRU combines theoretical insights with empirical evidence and historical examples
> - CORE starts with real-world problems and uses diverse methodological tools including empirical data, historical analysis, and game theory

Let's see, maybe i can verify if this is true in the future.
