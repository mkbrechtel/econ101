1.  [Mankiw's "Principles of Economics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Economics_(Mankiw_book)) is one of the most widely used introductory economics textbooks. It covers both microeconomics and macroeconomics, written by Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw. The book is known for its clear explanations of economic concepts and real-world applications.

2.  [Marginal Revolution University (MRU)](https://mru.org/) is an online educational platform created by economists Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok. They provide free economics education through videos and interactive content. Their courses cover everything from principles of economics to more specialized topics like development economics and monetary policy.

3.  [CORE (Curriculum Open-access Resources in Economics) Econ](https://www.core-econ.org/), also known as "The Economy," is a modern approach to teaching economics that was developed as an alternative to traditional textbooks. It's freely available online and integrates current economic issues, historical context, and empirical evidence into its curriculum. CORE emphasizes real-world applications and starts with more contemporary economic questions rather than traditional abstract models.
