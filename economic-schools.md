## Mercantilism (historical)

[Mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) is an economic system that emphasizes the accumulation of wealth through trade and commerce. It was a dominant economic theory during the European Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Mercantilism focused on increasing a nation's wealth by increasing its exports and reducing its imports. This was achieved through a combination of protectionist policies, such as tariffs and quotas, and state-sponsored colonization and exploration.

## Physiocracy (historical)

[Physiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy) is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of agriculture in generating wealth and prosperity. It was a major economic theory in France during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Physiocrats believed that agriculture was the primary source of wealth and that the government should intervene minimally in the economy to allow it to function naturally. They advocated for free trade, low taxes on agriculture, and protectionist policies for manufacturing industries.
