It was a dominant economic theory during the European Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Mercantilism focused on increasing a nation's wealth by increasing its exports and reducing its imports. This was achieved through a combination of protectionist policies, such as tariffs and quotas, and state-sponsored colonization and exploration.

It was a major economic theory in France during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Physiocrats believed that agriculture was the primary source of wealth and that the government should intervene minimally in the economy to allow it to function naturally.
