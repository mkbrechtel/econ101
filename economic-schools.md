## Mercantilism (historical)

[Mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) is an economic system that emphasizes the accumulation of wealth through trade and commerce. It was a dominant economic theory during the European Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Mercantilism focused on increasing a nation's wealth by increasing its exports and reducing its imports. This was achieved through a combination of protectionist policies, such as tariffs and quotas, and state-sponsored colonization and exploration.

## Physiocracy (historical)

[Physiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy) is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of agriculture in generating wealth and prosperity. It was a major economic theory in France during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Physiocrats believed that agriculture was the primary source of wealth and that the government should intervene minimally in the economy to allow it to function naturally. They advocated for free trade, low taxes on agriculture, and protectionist policies for manufacturing industries.

Last school before Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, came along.

## Ibne Khaldun (historical)

[Ibne Khaldun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun) was a Muslim scholar and historian who lived in the 14th century. He is best known for his work "The Muqaddimah," which is considered one of the earliest and most influential works of sociology and economics. In the book, Ibne Khaldun developed a theory of economic cycles, known as the "asabiya cycle," which suggests that societies go through periods of expansion and contraction due to changes in social cohesion and group identity. He also made significant contributions to the study of history, politics, and culture.

## Keyneynesianism

[Keynesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics) is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of government intervention in the economy to manage business cycles and promote full employment. It was developed by British economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s in response to the Great Depression. Keynesian economics argues that in a market economy, there may be times when private investment is insufficient to maintain full employment, and that government spending can help to stimulate demand and create jobs. Keynesian policies typically involve fiscal stimulus, such as government spending or tax cuts, and monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply.

econ-teacher Claude:

> Keynesianism is still very much applied today, though in evolved forms. It's not merely historical, but rather a foundational school of thought that has been built upon and synthesized with other approaches. Here's a more detailed breakdown:
>
> 1.  New Keynesian Economics:
>     This modern strand incorporates Keynesian insights about market imperfections and the role of aggregate demand with neoclassical microeconomic foundations. It's a dominant paradigm in much of current macroeconomic policy-making.
>
> 2.  Post-Keynesian Economics:
>     This heterodox approach builds more directly on Keynes' original ideas, emphasizing uncertainty, financial instability, and the importance of effective demand.
>
> 3.  Policy Applications:
>     Keynesian principles are evident in many current policy responses, particularly during economic downturns. For example, the fiscal and monetary stimuli deployed during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have strong Keynesian elements.
>
> 4.  Synthesis in Mainstream Macroeconomics:
>     Modern macroeconomic models, like Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models used by central banks, often incorporate both Keynesian and neoclassical elements.
>
> 5.  Ongoing Debates:
>     The extent to which Keynesian principles should guide policy remains a subject of debate, particularly regarding the effectiveness of fiscal policy and the role of government in economic stabilization.
>
> 6.  Econometric Applications:
>     Many econometric models used for policy analysis incorporate Keynesian elements, especially in studying short-run fluctuations and policy impacts.
>
> For someone with your background, delving into the mathematical formulations of New Keynesian models, exploring the econometric techniques used to test Keynesian hypotheses, and examining case studies of Keynesian policy applications in various countries could be valuable next steps. You might also find it interesting to compare and contrast Keynesian approaches with other schools of thought, such as Monetarism or Austrian economics, to develop a well-rounded perspective on current macroeconomic debates.
