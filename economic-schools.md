# Economics schools

## Mercantilism (historical)

[Mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) is an economic system that emphasizes the accumulation of wealth through trade and commerce. It was a dominant economic theory during the European Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Mercantilism focused on increasing a nation's wealth by increasing its exports and reducing its imports. This was achieved through a combination of protectionist policies, such as tariffs and quotas, and state-sponsored colonization and exploration.

## Physiocracy (historical)

[Physiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy) is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of agriculture in generating wealth and prosperity. It was a major economic theory in France during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Physiocrats believed that agriculture was the primary source of wealth and that the government should intervene minimally in the economy to allow it to function naturally. They advocated for free trade, low taxes on agriculture, and protectionist policies for manufacturing industries.

Last school before Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, came along.

## Ibne Khaldun (historical)

[Ibne Khaldun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun) was a Muslim scholar and historian who lived in the 14th century. He is best known for his work "The Muqaddimah," which is considered one of the earliest and most influential works of sociology and economics. In the book, Ibne Khaldun developed a theory of economic cycles, known as the "asabiya cycle," which suggests that societies go through periods of expansion and contraction due to changes in social cohesion and group identity. He also made significant contributions to the study of history, politics, and culture.

## Marginalist revolution

The marginal revolution was a major intellectual movement in economics that took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was led by a group of economists, including Leon Walras, Vilfredo Pareto, and Alfred Marshall, who sought to develop a more rigorous and mathematical approach to economics.

The marginalist revolution focused on the concept of marginal utility, which refers to the additional satisfaction that a consumer derives from consuming an additional unit of a good. Marginalists argued that the price of a good should be determined by the marginal utility that consumers derive from it, rather than by its cost of production. This led to the development of the theory of consumer demand, which explains how consumers make decisions about which goods to buy and how much to buy.

### Walras

[Leon Walras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Walras) was a French mathematician and economist who is considered one of the founders of modern general equilibrium theory. He developed a mathematical model of a competitive economy, known as the Walrasian auction, which is used to determine the equilibrium prices and quantities of goods in a market.

The Walrasian auction is a hypothetical market mechanism in which all goods are sold simultaneously in a series of auctions, with prices adjusting until a market equilibrium is reached. In this model, each consumer and producer is assumed to have perfect knowledge of the market and to act in their own self-interest. The Walrasian auction is a powerful tool for analyzing the effects of changes in demand, supply, or government policies on the economy as a whole.

###  Marshall

[Alfred Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Marshall) was a British economist who is considered one of the founders of modern economics. He made significant contributions to the fields of microeconomics, industrial organization, and international trade. Marshall is best known for his work "Principles of Economics," which was first published in 1890 and went through several editions. In the book, Marshall introduced the concept of marginal utility, which is a fundamental concept in modern microeconomic theory. He also developed the theory of the firm, which analyzes the behavior of firms in the market and their decision-making processes.

### Pareto

[Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto) was an Italian economist and sociologist who is best known for his work on the distribution of income and wealth. He developed the Pareto principle, which states that in a distribution, a small number of individuals typically control a large proportion of the resources. Pareto also made significant contributions to the fields of sociology, political science, and engineering.

## Keyneynesianism

[Keynesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics) is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of government intervention in the economy to manage business cycles and promote full employment. It was developed by British economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s in response to the Great Depression. Keynesian economics argues that in a market economy, there may be times when private investment is insufficient to maintain full employment, and that government spending can help to stimulate demand and create jobs. Keynesian policies typically involve fiscal stimulus, such as government spending or tax cuts, and monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply.

Keynesianism is still very much applied today, though in evolved forms. It's not merely historical, but rather a foundational school of thought that has been built upon and synthesized with other approaches. Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1.  New Keynesian Economics:
    This modern strand incorporates Keynesian insights about market imperfections and the role of aggregate demand with neoclassical microeconomic foundations. It's a dominant paradigm in much of current macroeconomic policy-making.
2.  Post-Keynesian Economics:
    This heterodox approach builds more directly on Keynes' original ideas, emphasizing uncertainty, financial instability, and the importance of effective demand.
3.  Policy Applications:
    Keynesian principles are evident in many current policy responses, particularly during economic downturns. For example, the fiscal and monetary stimuli deployed during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have strong Keynesian elements.
4.  Synthesis in Mainstream Macroeconomics:
    Modern macroeconomic models, like Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models used by central banks, often incorporate both Keynesian and neoclassical elements.
5.  Ongoing Debates:
    The extent to which Keynesian principles should guide policy remains a subject of debate, particularly regarding the effectiveness of fiscal policy and the role of government in economic stabilization.
6.  Econometric Applications:
    Many econometric models used for policy analysis incorporate Keynesian elements, especially in studying short-run fluctuations and policy impacts.

## Austrian School / Friedrich Hayek

[Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek) was an Austrian economist who is considered one of the founders of the  of economics. He is best known for his work "The Road to Serfdom," which argues that central planning and government intervention in the economy can lead to totalitarianism and the loss of individual freedom. Hayek's main contributions to economics include the development of the theory of price discovery, which suggests that prices in a free market reflect all available information about the costs and benefits of a good or service, and the theory of spontaneous order, which argues that complex systems can emerge from the interactions of individuals without the need for central planning.

The Austrian School of economics, which Hayek is a prominent figure of, is a heterodox school of thought that emphasizes the importance of individual freedom, the role of markets in coordinating economic activity, and the limitations of government intervention. Austrian economists often criticize Keynesian economics for its emphasis on government intervention and its assumption that markets are inherently unstable. They argue that Keynesian policies can lead to inflation, excessive government debt, and a loss of economic efficiency.

Critiques of the Auctrian School include its emphasis on the role of markets in coordinating economic activity, which can lead to the neglect of social and environmental concerns, and its assumption that markets are always efficient, which can overlook the presence of market failures and externalities.

## Nash

[John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.) was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to game theory, a branch of mathematics that studies strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. He is best known for his work on non-cooperative games, which involve players making decisions independently of each other, and his development of the concept of Nash equilibrium, which is a solution concept that describes the outcome of a non-cooperative game in which each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies of the other players.

## Schumpeter

[Joseph Schumpeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter) was an Austrian economist who is considered one of the founders of the field of economic development and the theory of innovation. He is best known for his book "Theory of Economic Development," which argues that economic growth is driven by the creation of new technologies and the introduction of new products and markets. Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction suggests that economic growth involves the destruction of existing industries and the creation of new ones, as new technologies and products disrupt the status quo and create new opportunities for growth.

Schumpeter's work has had a significant influence on the field of economics, particularly in the areas of economic development, innovation, and entrepreneurship. His theory of creative destruction has been applied to a wide range of industries, from technology to finance to retail, and has been used to explain the dynamics of economic growth and change.

Schumpeterian (innovation) rents are the profits that are earned by firms that are able to introduce new technologies, products, or services to the market. These rents are a result of the fact that new technologies and products create new demand and increase the value of existing products and services, allowing firms to charge higher prices and earn higher profits. Schumpeterian rents are a source of economic growth, as they allow firms to invest in new technologies and products, create new jobs, and expand their market share. However, they can also lead to market concentration and the creation of monopolies, which can have negative consequences for consumers and society as a whole.

## Ostrom

[Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) was an American economist who is considered one of the founders of the field of institutional economics, which studies the role of institutions in shaping economic outcomes. She is best known for her work on the governance of common-pool resources, which are resources that are shared by a group of individuals and are subject to the problem of the "tragedy of the commons," in which individuals have an incentive to overexploit the resource.

Ostrom's work has shown that successful governance of common-pool resources can emerge from local institutions and social norms, rather than from centralized government intervention. She identified eight principles that are necessary for the sustainable governance of common-pool resources, including:

1. Clearly defined boundaries: The resource must be clearly defined and bounded, with clear rules about who has access to it.
2. Multiple stakeholders: The resource must be managed by a group of stakeholders who have a vested interest in its sustainable use.
3. Collective decision-making: Decisions about the resource must be made collectively, through a process that is transparent, inclusive, and responsive to the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.
4. Monitoring and enforcement: There must be mechanisms in place to monitor the use of the resource and to enforce the rules that govern its use.
5. Graduated sanctions: Sanctions for violating the rules must be graduated, with milder penalties for minor infractions and more severe penalties for more serious violations.
6. Conflict resolution mechanisms: There must be mechanisms in place to resolve conflicts that arise over the use of the resource.
7. Adaptability: The rules and institutions governing the resource must be adaptable to changing circumstances, allowing for flexibility and innovation.
8. Equity and fairness: The rules and institutions governing the resource must be fair and equitable, ensuring that all stakeholders have a voice and a fair share of the benefits.

Ostrom's work has had a significant influence on the field of economics, particularly in the areas of environmental economics, public economics, and development economics. Her insights into the governance of common-pool resources have been applied to a wide range of contexts, from natural resources to public goods to digital commons.

## Lerner

[Abba Lerner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba_Lerner) was an American economist who made significant contributions to the fields of economic theory and economic policy. He is best known for his work on the theory of industrial organization, particularly his contributions to the theory of oligopoly and the theory of monopolistic competition.

Lerner's work on oligopoly challenged the traditional assumption that firms in an oligopolistic market have no incentive to collude and fix prices, as they would be able to gain market share at the expense of their competitors. Instead, Lerner argued that firms in an oligopolistic market may have an incentive to collude and fix prices if they believe that their competitors will also engage in collusive behavior, and if they believe that the benefits of collusion outweigh the costs. Lerner's work on oligopoly has been influential in shaping modern antitrust policy and has been used to justify the use of competition policy to address market power and promote competition.

He developed a model of market socialism that combines elements of both market and socialist systems. In this model, the government plays a role in setting prices and allocating resources, but the market is still allowed to operate and allocate resources based on supply and demand. Lerner's model of market socialism has been influential in shaping modern economic policy and has been used to justify the use of market-based mechanisms to allocate resources in socialist systems.

The Marshall-Lerner condition is a concept in economics that describes the relationship between the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of supply. It states that for a firm to be profitable in the long run, the sum of the price elasticities of demand and supply must be greater than one. This condition is named after Albert Marshall and Abba Lerner, who independently derived it in the early 20th century. The Marshall-Lerner condition is used to analyze the impact of changes in demand and supply on a firm's profitability and to understand the conditions under which a firm can sustain its profits over time.
